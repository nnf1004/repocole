# 2. What is the distribution of US conversions by day of week (i.e., Mon - Fri)? (boxplots or histograms)

# 3. What is the distribution of US conversions by month? (boxplots or histogram)

# 4. Fit a linear regression model with daily US convsersions as your response (total across all marketing channels) and Day of week (i.e., Mon - Fri) as the covariate. What is the coefficient on Monday? What does this mean?

### Question 1
```{r}
#Question 1 What are the top 5 countries in terms of Display Ad conversions?

q1 <- conversions %>% 
  filter(marketing_channel == "Display Ads") %>% 
  group_by(country_code) %>% 
  summarise(tot_conv = sum(conversions, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_conv))

#us: 4468724
#fr: 669585
#be: 373629
#pt: 171598
#ie: 109575


```


### Questiob 2
```{r}
#Question 2 What is the distribution of US conversions by day of week (i.e., Mon - Fri)? (boxplots or histograms)

q2 <- conversions %>% 
  filter(country_code == "us") %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(datestamp, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(day %in% c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"))

#Histogram
ggplot(data = q2, mapping = aes(x = conversions)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~day)

#Boxplot
ggplot(data = q2, mapping = aes(x = conversions)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~day)
  
```


#Question 3
```{r}
#3 What is the distribution of US conversions by month? (boxplots or histogram)

q3 <- conversions %>% 
  filter(country_code == "us") %>% 
  mutate(month = month(datestamp, label = TRUE)) 

#Histogram
ggplot(data = q3, mapping = aes(x = conversions)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~month)

#Boxplot
ggplot(data = q3, mapping = aes(x = conversions)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~month)

```

### Question 4
```{r}

# 4. Fit a linear regression model with daily US convsersions as your response (total across all marketing channels) and Day of week (i.e., Mon - Fri) as the covariate. What is the coefficient on Monday? What does this mean?

q4 <- conversions %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(datestamp, label = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(country_code == "us") %>% 
  filter(day %in% c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri")) %>% 
  mutate(day2 =  as.character(day))
  

lm4 <- lm(conversions ~ day2, q4)

summary(lm4)

```
The coefficient on Monday is 1234.4. This means that compared to friday, the conversions on monday will be 1234.4 greater, ceteris paribus.
